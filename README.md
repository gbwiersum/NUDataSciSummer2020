Uses:
Python 3.7 or greater
dataset from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/coronavirus/genomes/

To use, download 'coronaviridae' dataset and unzip. Move notebook to same folder as unzipped files.

TODO:
Implement and confirm validity of clade clusters (k-means?)
Create a more polished bit of code to return similarity to known coronaviruses and place on evolutionary tree (what cluster would this sequence belong to?)
